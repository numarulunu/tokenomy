# tokenomy

**Cut Claude Code token burn by 80%+ with zero code changes.**

tokenomy is a Claude Code plugin that bundles ~10 token-optimization techniques into a single install: environment variables, runtime hooks that block redundant file reads and filter log files, a ccusage statusline, project templates, and a behavioral ruleset that nudges Claude toward efficient output.

## Bird's-eye view

| Layer | Before | With tokenomy |
|---|---|---|
| Env vars | Default (200k ctx, verbose thinking, auto-memory, telemetry) | 70% autocompact, 8k thinking, 8k output cap, telemetry off, auto-memory off |
| File reads | Same file re-read 5–10x per session | `read-once` hook blocks re-reads of unchanged files |
| Log reads | Full 10k-line log injected into context | `log-grep` hook returns errors + last 50 lines (~95% reduction) |
| Project discovery | Claude walks `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, lockfiles, DBs | `.claudeignore` + `respectGitignore: true` skip them |
| Output | "Here's what I did…" + full file re-quoted | Diffs only, no preamble |
| Statusline | Nothing | ccusage — live token/cost counter |
| Behavior | Re-reads, re-verifies, over-explains | CLAUDE.md rules: Serena-first, delegate exploration, /rewind not verbal corrections |

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add github:numarulunu/tokenomy
/plugin install tokenomy
```

Restart Claude Code. That's it. All hooks, env vars, and the statusline wire up automatically.

### Dependencies (optional but recommended)

- **ccusage statusline** — needs `npx` on PATH (ships with Node.js)
- **Serena MCP** — install separately if you want LSP-powered code navigation. tokenomy's CLAUDE.md tells Claude to prefer it when available.

tokenomy does **not** bundle Serena or ccusage. It only configures Claude Code to use them if present.

## What each piece does

### Hooks (the headline feature)

**`read-once`** — `PreToolUse` hook on `Read`. Maintains a per-session cache of `(file_path, offset, limit) → mtime`. If Claude tries to read the same range of an unchanged file twice, the hook blocks the second call with a stub message pointing back to the version already in context. Mtime changes bypass the cache automatically.

**`log-grep`** — `PreToolUse` hook on `Read`. When the target matches `*.log`, `*/log/*`, or `*/logs/*`, the hook returns only lines matching `ERROR|WARN|FAIL|Exception|Traceback|CRITICAL|FATAL` (capped at last 200) plus the last 50 lines of the file. Include the token `!fulllog` in your prompt to bypass. Files under 200 lines pass through unchanged. Binary files named `*.log` pass through unchanged.

**`cleanup`** — `SessionEnd` hook. Removes per-session cache files and sweeps stale tmp.

All three hooks **fail open**. On parse error, missing file, corrupt cache, or any other edge case, the hook approves the read. A buggy hook will never hard-break your session.

### Env vars

Set via plugin `settings.json`:

- `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=70` — compact at 70% ctx instead of 92%, preventing the "fell off a cliff" moment
- `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=8000` — caps extended thinking at 8k instead of unlimited
- `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=8000` — caps output per turn
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` — no telemetry pings
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` — no silent memory injections
- `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` — deferred tool schemas, loaded on demand

### Statusline

ccusage — live token usage and cost counter pinned to the bottom of the terminal.

### Templates

- `templates/.claudeignore` — universal exclude list (Python, Node, DBs, logs, media, lockfiles)
- `templates/project-settings.json` — minimal `.claude/settings.json` with `respectGitignore: true` and sane permission scopes

Use these via the `token-audit` skill (see below) or copy them manually into new projects.

### `token-audit` skill

Say "audit tokens" or "tokenomy this project" and Claude will run the `token-audit` skill: check for `.claudeignore` and `.claude/settings.json` in the current project, create them from templates if missing, scan for obvious bloat (big tracked files, leaked caches), and report findings. Scope is configuration only — it never touches source code.

### CLAUDE.md

Plugin-scoped behavioral rules:
- Diffs only, no preamble, no trailing summaries
- Never re-read a file after editing it
- Grep first, read the range, not the whole file
- Serena-first for code symbols
- Delegate >3-query explorations to subagents
- Sonnet default, Haiku for trivial, Opus only when the user flags it
- Tell the user to `/rewind` instead of verbally correcting failed paths

User's own `CLAUDE.md` always takes precedence.

## Verifying it works

After install:
1. Check the statusline — should show a live token counter.
2. Ask Claude to read the same file twice. Second read should be blocked with a `[tokenomy]` message.
3. Ask Claude to read any `.log` file >200 lines. It should see a `[tokenomy] Log filtered:` header instead of the full file.
4. Run `env | grep CLAUDE` in a Bash tool call — should show the 6 tokenomy env vars.

## Uninstall

```
/plugin uninstall tokenomy
```

All hooks and env vars are scoped to the plugin. Uninstalling removes them cleanly. Your own `~/.claude/settings.json` is never touched.
